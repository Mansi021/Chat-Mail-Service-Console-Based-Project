# Chat-Mail-Service-Console-Based-Project

Messaging apps currently have been more global 
users than traditional social networks, implying 
that they will play a bigger role in digital journalism 
delivery in the future. People used to like interacting
with one another and exchanging their ideas.

That's why through this project I hope to create a system 
that will assist the concerned user in efficiently
sending and receiving message in an easy and flexible manner
while also saving the users time and effort. It is a user-
friendly project and consist of various sections like:- 
creating a username and passwords for themselves- allowing 
the system to be readily upgraded, login into their personal
chatroom with their username and password mentioned earlier.
Aside from that, we provide many chat options: for showing
the message (the message that was sent to the user by other 
people), for sending message (to send a reply or start a 
conversation with the other user), for deleting all received messages, 
for viewing sent message log, for clearing the log and lastly to log out of 
the chatroom.
